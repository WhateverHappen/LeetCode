# 26 - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
>easy

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

For example,
Given input array nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

## Solution
### Algorithm
Since the array is already sorted, we can keep two pointers i and j, where i is the slow-runner while j is the fast-runner. As long as nums[i] = nums[j], we increment j to skip the duplicate.

When we encounter nums[j]â‰ nums[i], the duplicate run has ended so we must copy its value to nums[i + 1]. i is then incremented and we repeat the same process again until j reaches the end of array.
